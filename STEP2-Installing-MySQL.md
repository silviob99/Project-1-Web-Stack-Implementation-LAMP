What exactly is Apache?  

[Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/) is the most widely used web server software. Developed and maintained by Apache Software Foundation. Apache is 
an open source software available for free. It runs on 67% of all webservers in the world. It is fast, reliable, and secure. It can be highly customised
to meet the needs of many different environments by using extensions and modules. Most wordPress hosting providers use Apache as their wer server software. However,
websites and other applications can run on other web server software as well. Such as [Nginx](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-open-source/), [Microsoft IIS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/iis/get-started/introduction-to-iis/introduction-to-iis-architecture), etc.

The Apache web server is among the most popular web servers in the world. It's well documented, has an active community of users, and has been in wide use for much of the history of the web, which makes it a great default choice for hosting a website.
